## BlogFolio :camera:

It's an application which helps you build your portfolio. Too mainstream, right? 
So we help you build a semi formal portfolio which shows your true identity and persona to everyone.
What are the perks of using this application? Build portfolio, write and publish blogs in the field of your interest.
Your profile will speak about your professional and personal interests.
